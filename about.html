            <h1>Hi, I'm Juno.</h1>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in Massachusetts, and currently live in upstate New York for most of the year. 
                I am currently studying at Clarkson University for a B.S. in Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my childhood, I was very interested in music, computers, photography, and robotics.
                In high school, I played the trombone and euphonium in concert & marching band, and participated
                as the field technician and programmer for the FIRST robotics team.
            </p>
            <p>
                Going into college, my interests in photography and music have been somewhat put on the back burner,
                although I do try to get out there and take photos or play my guitar when I have the chance.
            </p>
            <p>
                While at college, I maintain an active membership in a few clubs:<br>
                - COSI (Clarkson Open Source Institute)<br>
                - K2CC (Amateur Radio Club)<br>
                - WTSC (FM Radio Station - 91.1 if you're in town)<br>
                - GSA (Gender & Sexuality Alliance)<br>
            </p>
