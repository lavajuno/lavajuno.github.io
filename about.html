            <h1>Hi, I'm Juno.</h1>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in central Massachusetts, and currently live in upstate New York for most of the year. 
                I graduated high school in 2021, and I am currently studying at Clarkson University for a B.S. in Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my childhood, I was very interested in music, computers, photography, and robotics.
                In high school, I played the trombone and euphonium in concert & marching band, and participated
                as the field technician and programmer for the FIRST robotics team.
            </p>
            <p>
                Going into college, my interests in photography and music have been somewhat put on the back burner,
                although I do try to get out there and take photos or play my guitar when I have the chance.
            </p>
            <p>While at college, I maintain an active membership in a few clubs:</p>
            <p> - COSI (Clarkson Open Source Institute)</p>
            <p> - K2CC (Amateur Radio Club)</p>
            <p> - WTSC (FM Radio Station - 91.1 if you're in town)</p>
            <p> - GSA (Gender & Sexuality Alliance)</p>
            <p>I currently serve as president of K2CC.</p>

                    <h3>"goose"</h3>
                    <p>I built Goose last year to upgrade from my previous desktop of 5 years.<br>
                        It's equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X (6 cores, 12 threads @ 4.6 GHz), 
                        32GB DDR4-3200, an AMD RX 6700 XT, and a 1TB NVME SSD. 
                        I really don't have anything I can throw at it that will make it sluggish.
                        Hopefully it stays this way for a few years.

                    <p>I built Topaz in fall semester 2022 completely from parts found in E-waste.<br>
                        It's equipped with an Intel Core i7-4790 (4 cores, 8 threads @ 4.0 GHz), 16GB DDR3-1600,
                        and a 500GB SSD. It was built from a HP SFF desktop, and has a new CPU, RAM,
                        storage, and power supply. It's a capable, compact workstation system.
