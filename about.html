        <h1>Hi, I'm Juno.</h1>
        <p>
            I was born and raised in central Massachusetts, and currently live in upstate New York for most of the year. 
            I graduated high school in 2021, and I am currently studying at Clarkson University for a B.S. in Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my childhood, I was very interested in music, computers, photography, and robotics.
            In high school, I played the trombone and euphonium in concert & marching band, and participated
            as the field technician and programmer for the FIRST robotics team.
        </p>
        <p>
            Going into college, my interests in photography and music have been somewhat put on the back burner,
            although I do try to get out there and take photos or play my guitar when I have the chance.
        </p>
        <p>While at college, I maintain an active membership in a few clubs:</p>
        <p> - COSI (Clarkson Open Source Institute)</p>
        <p> - K2CC (Amateur Radio Club)</p>
        <p> - WTSC (FM Radio Station - 91.1 if you're in town)</p>
        <p> - GSA (Gender & Sexuality Alliance)</p>
        <p>I currently serve as president of K2CC.</p>

                <h3>"The Black Box"</h3>
                <p>I built this system last year to upgrade from my previous desktop of 5 years.<br>
                    It's equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X (6 cores, 12 threads @ 4.6 GHz), 
                    32GB DDR4-3200, an AMD RX 6700 XT, and a 1TB NVME SSD. 
                    I really don't have anything I can throw at it that will make it sluggish.
                    Hopefully it stays this way for a few years.
